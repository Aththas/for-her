          <p>
            It’s incredible to think how, just a year ago, I didn’t even know anything about you. Meeting you was a moment of fate that I’ll always be grateful for.

            At first, I wasn’t sure how we’d connect, what we’d talk about, or what kind of person you’d be. But now, after spending time with you, I’ve realized something truly special, 

            You’re absolutely amazing. 💖 <br/><br/>

            Your words, your kindness, and the way you make me smile have already made a place in my heart. I never expected to meet someone like you, but now, I can’t imagine not having you in my life.

            Maybe it was destiny, or maybe it was just luck, but whatever it was, I’m glad it brought me to you. 💕
